## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [Gold Price Prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Zm09vnOE5du94WJZZoyzy5mSI0YKtUlI?usp=sharing)
Empirical Analysis methods for building Gold Price Prediction syttems have become a crucial area of research in recent years. Most implemented techniques are based on using a particular learning algorithm like Random Forest and applying it to an unseen dataset. This proposed method aims to present a technique that cleans and splits a single country’s gold prices data, train data mining models like Linear Regression, LSTM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Ad- aboost on a single country’s data, find performance metrics like r-squared Error, Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute error to find the best-performing model as per the performance metrics and ap- ply that model on other countries’ gold prices for forecasting. The goal is to analyze performance to find similar/different trends with different regional data. After evaluating the performance metrics for different models on United States’ gold prices from 1990-2021, Recurrent Neural Network(LSTM) has performed overall better with Random Forest, XGboost mainly showing the overfitting re- sults due to the limited data points. Using the same model Recurrent Neural Network for the Gold Price Prediction for other regions like Europe and Canada is also working similarly with great results.

### [Blogging Platform (Spring Boot)](https://github.com/shubhamX1438/bloggingSpringboot])
The Blogging Platform is a robust web application built with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf, designed for seamless blog creation and management. It empowers users to create, edit, and delete blog posts while providing an admin dashboard to manage users and content efficiently. The platform integrates a MySQL database for data persistence and uses intuitive Thymeleaf templates for a clean and user-friendly interface. This project serves as an ideal foundation for building dynamic content management systems with modern Java technologies, making it perfect for developers and content creators looking to streamline their workflows.

### [Autonomous Vehicle Collision Detection](https://github.com/shubhamX1438/Autonomous-Vehicle-Collision-Detection/tree/main)
This project endeavors to create a safety-driven framework tailored for autonomous vehicles, concentrating on the real-time monitoring of vital passenger health metrics. With a specific focus on intoxication levels, respiratory rate, heart rate, BMI, and sleepiness, the project aims to develop an adaptive advisory control system. The primary challenge lies in crafting a responsive system capable of dynamically adjusting to these varied metrics. By integrating these health parameters into the autonomous vehicle’s control mechanisms, the goal is to guarantee a secure and comfortable travel experience, thereby enhancing safety in autonomous transportation.

### [Fraud-Detection-with-Graph-Databases-and-machine-learning](https://github.com/shubhamX1438/Fraud-Detection-with-Graph-Databases-and-machine-learning)
As online banking transactions become increasingly popular, the threat of fraudulent activity has also risen, causing harm to both customers and financial institutions. Machine learning and data mining techniques can be employed to analyze the large volume of transactional data generated daily and identify patterns and anomalies that indicate fraudulent activity. This project uses a dataset created by a ”BankSim” simulator and employs graph-based features and various machine learning algorithms to efficiently detect and prevent fraudulent activities such as fraudsters, pranksters, or salespeople. Effective fraud prevention not only mitigates financial risk but also maintains member trust and confidence, minimizes reputational risk, and sustains profitability for banks. Automating the fraud detection process through machine learning algorithms is therefore a promising solution for ensuring the security and trustworthiness of online banking services.

### [Data Visualization - PEARL Emotion analysis](https://github.com/shubhamX1438/extra-credit-dv)
Millions engage daily on social media like Twitter/Facebook, leaving digital footprints of their emotions through posts and images. Our project, inspired by "PEARL: An Interactive Visual Analytic Tool," uses machine learning and analytical visualizations to track emotional trends from Twitter data, providing insights into personal emotional profiles and aiding marketing strategies. The tool visualizes emotions across eight categories using a multi-river graph, highlighting emotional states through color-coded valences. My role encompassed dataset creation, data wrangling for WordCloud, and developing visualizations using D3.js, enhancing my skills in web programming and data analysis.

### [hotspotanalysis project - Apache Spark with Scala](https://github.com/shubhamX1438/hotspotanalysis-project---Apache-Spark-with-Scala)
Here, for hotspotanalysis project, we are specifically using SCALA and Spark to do all the magic. Scala is a high level programming language and it is known for its concise syntax and functional programming capabilities. It is highly used with Java due to it’s efficiency and interoperability. On the other hand, Spark is an open source distributed computing system which provides creating entire clusters with data parallelism and fault tolerance. It is highly used in big data applications and analytics and it is known for it’s capabilities of handling large-scala data processing tasks.

### [Data Visualization - Linking charts](https://github.com/shubhamX1438/extra-credit-dv)
The purpose of this homework is to give you practice interactively building and linking visualizations together in D3. By the end of this assignment you should be able to:
Dynamically create and parse a CSV dataset in JavaScript
Plot values in a Multi-Scatter chart
Plot values in a Circular Bar chart
Dynamically update a chart based on user interactions
Add a tooltip
